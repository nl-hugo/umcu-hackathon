# UMCU hackathon | Admissions at the Psychiatric department

## Overview
This repository contains the results of the [hackathon](http://blog.godatadriven.com/hackathon-umcutrecht.html) at the psychiatry unit of UMC Utrecht at November 12th, 2015. 


## Goal
The goal of this afternoon was to explore a dataset that was prepared by the psychiatry unit and draw up some interesting results. 

## Results
Because the dataset, although anonimized, contains patient details it is not included in this repository. As such, running the code will not produce any results. However a screenshot is attached below to summarize the findings of the project:
